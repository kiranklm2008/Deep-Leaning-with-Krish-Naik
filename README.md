Churn Modelling
Introduction
This data set contains details of a bank's customers and the target variable is a binary variable reflecting the fact whether the #### customer left the bank (closed his account) or he continues to be a customer.
Summary Information about the variables and their types in the data

11) EstimatedSalary : The estimated salary of the customer
12) Exited : Churned or not? (0=No,1=Yes)
